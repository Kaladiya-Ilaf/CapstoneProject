**Creating a Resnet-50 model to classify chest xray into as infected by covid-19 or not.**

## Steps :
### Import required Libraries
### Load the data
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12LjtyjiHupDBtklQjLiOQ82dte2cHGV2?usp=drive_link
### The images are in different sizes so you have to take a fixed size on which you have to work.
resize images are store in :
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dys296Ys6azJ-c4WKQIyY6Tc77rQmVqo?usp=drive_link

### Creating and dividing covid images in train and test folders.

You can find the details of splitting of images in this folder.

### Using ResNet-50 Pretrained Model and train the existing weights we just have to train our last layer.
### Augment the data, train the model and plot the result.
### Finally, predict the class of new image using the saved model.
